# Single Variable Calculus
Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases on conceptual understanding and applications. 

Distinguishing features of the course include:
- the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning
- a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus
- an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational
- a clear, dynamic, unified approach.
